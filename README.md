This repository contains code I wrote for practice while learning Go. Currently, it has three major sections:
- [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour)
- [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) courses and projects
  - [Learn Go](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-golang) course
  - [Build a Pokedex](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-pokedex-cli) project
  - [Learn Web Servers](https://blog.boot.dev/tutorials/learn-http-servers-golang-deprecated/) course (`chirpy` project)
- [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests)
