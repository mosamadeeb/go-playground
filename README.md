# go-playground

This repository contains code I wrote for practice while learning Go. Currently, it has two major sections:
- [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour)
- [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) courses and projects
  - [Learning Go](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-golang) course
  - [Build a Pokedex](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-pokedex-cli) project
